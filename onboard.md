## Phase 1: The Immediate Conversation

*(The app opens. There is NO introductory text with a button. The user is immediately presented with the first message and the first question in a single view.)*

**Coach:** Hi there. To get started, let's discover what makes you tick. We call it your Motivational DNA.

**Coach:** When it comes to your core abilities, which of these feels closer to your view?

> **[ My abilities can be developed with effort. ]**
> **[ My abilities are mostly stable. ]**

---

## Phase 2: The Adaptive Onboarding Dialogue

*(The back-and-forth dialogue continues from the first interaction. The Coach's response is determined by the user's selection.)*

### Post-Question 1: Mindset
* **If "developed...":** > **Coach:** Excellent. You see skills as something that can be built. That belief in growth is a powerful foundation for everything we'll do together.
* **If "stable...":** > **Coach:** Understood. So your view is that our core skills are pretty well set. That's a common perspective, and it gives us a clear starting point. We can focus on leveraging your natural strengths.

### Question 2: Agency
**Coach:** Next, when you think about your successes, which feels more true for you?
> **[ I'm the primary driver of my success. ]**
> **[ Success is often influenced by external factors. ]**

* **If "primary driver...":** > **Coach:** Understood. A strong sense of personal agency. That tells me you're ready to take direct action.
* **If "external factors...":** > **Coach:** That's a really important insight. Seeing the whole picture—both our own actions and the world around us—is key. We can definitely work with that.

### Question 3: Motivation Source
**Coach:** Now, think about what gets you started on a new project. What's the bigger pull?
> **[ The internal satisfaction of learning or solving the problem. ]**
> **[ The external results, like recognition or rewards. ]**

* **If "internal satisfaction...":** > **Coach:** Good to know. You're fueled by intrinsic motivation—the process itself is the reward. That's a powerful engine for creativity.
* **If "external results...":** > **Coach:** That's very clear. You're driven by tangible outcomes. We can use that to set up rewarding goals that keep you energized.

### Question 4: Approach to Challenges
**Coach:** And when you face a new, complex challenge, what is your typical first impulse?
> **[ To start taking action and experimenting. ]**
> **[ To step back, analyze, and form a plan first. ]**

* **If "start taking action...":** > **Coach:** A bias for action. You learn by doing. We'll make sure your plan has plenty of room for experimentation.
* **If "step back, analyze...":** > **Coach:** A strategic mindset. You build confidence through planning. We'll focus on creating clear, well-structured paths forward.

### Question 5: Focus Style
**Coach:** Let's talk about focus. When you're working, what's more likely to be true for you?
> **[ I prefer to dive deep and concentrate on one big thing at a time. ]**
> **[ I'm comfortable switching between several different tasks or projects. ]**

* **If "dive deep...":** > **Coach:** That's great information. You thrive with deep focus. We'll find ways to protect that focus and direct it effectively.
* **If "comfortable switching...":** > **Coach:** Good to know. You're adaptable and can manage multiple streams of work. We can use that flexibility to make progress on several fronts at once.

### Question 6: Risk Tolerance
**Coach:** Okay, think about a situation where you're facing a choice with an uncertain outcome. Which path sounds more like you?
> **[ I prefer the safe, reliable path, even if the reward is smaller. ]**
> **[ I'm drawn to the riskier path if it has a bigger potential payoff. ]**

* **If "safe, reliable path...":** > **Coach:** That's great information. You value stability and predictability. We'll focus on building a plan with clear, reliable steps that minimize uncertainty.
* **If "riskier path...":** > **Coach:** Got it. You're energized by big opportunities and comfortable with a degree of risk. We can build a plan that includes high-leverage actions and bold experiments.

### Question 7: Social Orientation
**Coach:** Now, when you think about tackling a major goal, what environment helps you do your best work?
> **[ I do my best thinking and work when I have quiet time to myself. ]**
> **[ I get energized and find clarity by talking through ideas with others. ]**

* **If "quiet time to myself...":** > **Coach:** That's very clear. You're a "solo processor" who thrives on independent focus. We'll make sure your steps are built around that strength.
* **If "talking through ideas with others...":** > **Coach:** Excellent. You're a "social processor" who gains momentum from collaboration. We can build accountability and partnership right into your plan.

### Final Question: The Goal Context
**Coach:** Okay, last question. What's one challenge you're facing or one goal you're striving for right now?

## Phase 3: The First "Aha!" Moment (The Snapshot)

*(After the user submits their free-response goal.)*

**Coach:** Thank you for sharing that. Naming the focus is the most important part of the process. That gives your Motivational DNA a clear direction.

**Coach:** Let's see how it all connects in your Snapshot.

*(A brief loading/thinking animation is shown. The app then transitions to the Snapshot screen.)*

**SNAPSHOT SCREEN:**

* **Headline:** `Your Motivational DNA Snapshot`
* **Body:** `Here's what we've learned from our conversation. This isn't a test or a score, but your personal blueprint. We'll use this to build a plan that works for you.`
* *(The various insight cards for the 7 dimensions are displayed here.)*
* **Final Section Headline:** `Connecting Your DNA to Your Goal`
* **Body:** `So, how does this all relate to the challenge you mentioned? Your unique profile gives us the perfect clue for the best way to start.`

---

## Phase 4: The Second "Aha!" Moment (The Free ISFS)

*(The Snapshot screen seamlessly transitions to this new screen, revealing the first step.)*

**Headline:** `Your First Step`

**Coach:** Based on your DNA, the most effective first step isn't a giant leap, but a small, strategic action designed for your specific style.

*(The tailored ISFS is displayed clearly. Example:)*

> **Your Step:** Lay out your workout clothes before you go to bed tonight. That's it. The goal is just to do that one small thing.

**Coach:** Give it a try when the time is right, and we'll check in later.

---

## Phase 5: The Reflection Loop (Post-ISFS)

*(The next time the user opens the app after being given the ISFS, they see this prompt.)*

**Coach:** Welcome back. How did it go with laying out your clothes?

*(User is presented with reflective options.)*

> **[ I did it. It felt surprisingly easy. ]**
> **[ I did it, but it felt a bit silly. ]**
> **[ I didn't get around to it. ]**
> **[ Something else came up. ]**

---

## Phase 6: The Paywall Bridge

*(Immediately after the user selects an option from the reflective prompt.)*

**Coach:** Thanks for sharing that. That's useful information, and it helps me know what to suggest next. Taking these small, consistent steps is the key to building real momentum.

**Coach:** Are you ready for your next step?

*(The app transitions to the paywall screen.)*

**PAYWALL SCREEN:**

* **Headline:** `Let's Keep the Momentum Going.`
* **Body:** `You've already seen how a personalized first step can make a difference. The real power of LocusOfYou is turning that one action into a consistent practice.`
* **Sub-Body:** `Subscribing unlocks your full, ongoing coaching experience. We'll help you reflect on every step, adapt your plan based on how it goes, and reveal your next step, every single time.`
* **Key Benefits List:**
  * An Adaptive Plan that Evolves With You
  * Unlock Your Next Step, and the Next...
  * Ongoing Insights from Your Personal AI Coach
* **Button:** `[ Unlock My Full Plan ]`

## Phase 7: The Post-Paywall Experience

*(Upon successful payment, the user is immediately returned to the conversational UI.)*

**Coach:** Perfect, we're all set. It's great to have you on board.

*(The coach immediately delivers the second, adapted step based on the user's reflection.)*

* **Example (if user chose "felt surprisingly easy"):**
  > **Coach:** Since that felt easy, let's build on that momentum. Your next step is to put on those workout clothes as soon as you get up. You don't have to work out—the goal is just to put on the uniform. Let's see how that feels.

*(The new step is now displayed clearly as the current focus, fully onboarding the user into the core app loop.)*
